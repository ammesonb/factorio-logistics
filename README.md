# factorio-logistics
This tool aims to supplement in-game mods like Factory Planner and Helmod.
While those tools excel in managing resource inputs/outputs, factory efficiency and counts, and other production-related attributes, at megabase scales they do not provide holistic logistic views for resource and production chains.

The website built by Factorio Logistics provides the following benefits:
- A global resource summary across all lines, allowing for easy viewing of under-utilized or over-taxed resources
- Per-resource view to identify where most of an item is going, or where it comes from
- Nested organization of production lines, for easier management
- Supports ***any and all mods*** by using data from the built-in Factorio export feature
